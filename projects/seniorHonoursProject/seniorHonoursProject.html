                    From September to November 2024 (a duration of 10 weeks), I worked on my senior honors project, which investigated how the curvature of 
                    a single bacterium influences its rotational dynamics in a shear fluid. My project was supervised by Dr. Tyler N. Shendruk and Dr. Gavin Melaugh.

                    As an overview, Large groups of so called "banana-shaped" particles suspended in a fluid can serve as a useful model for understanding how bacterial movement contributes 
                    to sludge bulking in wastewater treatment. To study this, it's helpful to first look at how a single bacterium behaves in a shear fluid. By treating the bacterium 
                    like one of these banana-shaped particles and using a computer simulation method called Molecular Dynamics with Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics, we can study how its 
                    rotational dynamics changes as we adjust its curvature from a rod to fully circular (0 to 360 degrees).

                    The bacterium is placed in a fluid with a constant flow and is confined within a 2D box where the vertical walls are set with periodic boundary conditions and the horizontal walls 
                    are programmed with bounce back boundary conditions. The study shows that the bacterium follows a predictable rotational path known as Jeffery's Orbit. However, 
                    we conclude that noise (random fluctuations) has a much bigger impact on the bacterium's rotation than the curvature itself. This is shown by the PÃ©clet number, 
                    which has an order of magnitude of 10, meaning that although the shear flow dominates, it is only one order of magnitude above one thus noise is still a considerable factor. 
                    This is reflected in the results as these noise effects lead to significant differences from what the theory predicts, stressing the importance of considering noise in models that simulate 
                    bacterial movement in wastewater systems.
