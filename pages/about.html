        <h2>Heylo!!!</h2>

            <p>                
                Iâ€™m Emma, and welcome to my corner of the internet. I enjoy developing and applying 
                computer science techniques, particularly AI, machine learning, and statistical analysis, to 
                problems in the physical sciences. My main research interests are climate change and high-energy 
                physics and my ultimate goal is to build a career using computational methods to address 
                challenges in these areas.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                I recently completed my BSc (Hons) in Computational Physics at the University of Edinburgh, 
                including a year abroad at UCLA. I am now pursuing an MPhil in Data Intensive Science 
                at the University of Cambridge, where I am continuing to develop my technical and analytical 
                skills through advanced study in scientific computing, statistical analysis, and machine learning. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
                Across academic and industry settings, I have worked on a variety of projects, 
                from modelling bacterial motion in fluid flows to analysing climate variability. 
                What I enjoy most is addressing problems where scientific understanding directly shapes 
                computational modelling. Applying physics to develop and refine models not only advances 
                the code but also uncovers new insights that deepen our collective knowledge. For example, 
                in a data compression project, I applied entropy concepts to enhance compression algorithms 
                for a large language model dataset.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                I like to think life is more than academics, even if study has taken much of my time recently. 
                In my free moments, I enjoy playing piano, baking and reading. I especially love 
                being outdoors, gardening, wild-swimming, <a href="diving.html">scuba diving</a> and hill-walking. I love being in nature 
                and find a sense of peace being outside. Of course these moments are always better with my friends and 
                family, whose support and joy improve my life in every way.
            </p>
